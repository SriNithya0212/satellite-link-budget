# Satellite Link Budget

This project performs a satellite link budget analysis using MATLAB.
A microstrip patch antenna is designed and simulated in HFSS to obtain antenna gain,
which is then used in MATLAB to compute received power, noise power, C/N ratio, and link margin.

## Tools Used
- MATLAB
- ANSYS HFSS

## Key Parameters
- Frequency: 5 GHz
- Bandwidth: 15 MHz
- Bit rate: 6 Mbps
- Antenna Gain: 4.18 dBi

## Outputs
- Free Space Path Loss (FSPL)
- Received Power
- Noise Power
- C/N Ratio
- Link Margin
